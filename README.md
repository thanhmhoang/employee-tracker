## Description

For this Module 12 Challenge, the challege was as developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. The assignment was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The motivation for this project was to help the user easily manage their employee database to keep up with organizational changes in an organized manner. this help strengthen my skills using Node.js and MySQL.
